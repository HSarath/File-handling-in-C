Here I have updated the code as per discussion as the requirement was to reduce the memory usage for printing the particular pattern 
Here I have used Fseek function and pointer  to determine the total number of lines in the file and then a loop is used to take the corresponding value from the file and it is just stored into a character array and then  it is printed
